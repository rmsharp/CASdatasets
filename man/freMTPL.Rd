\title{ French Motor Third-Part Liability datasets }

\description{
In the two datasets \code{freMTPLfreq},  \code{freMTPLsev}, risk features are collected
for 413,169 motor third-part liability policies (observed on a year).
In addition, we have claim numbers by policy as well as the corresponding
claim amounts.
\code{freMTPLfreq} contains the risk features and the claim number
while \code{freMTPLsev} contains the claim amount and the 
corresponding policy ID.

In the two datasets \code{freMTPL2freq},  \code{freMTPL2sev}, risk features are collected
for 677,991 motor third-part liability policies (observed on a year).
In addition, we have claim numbers by policy as well as the corresponding
claim amounts.
\code{freMTPL2freq} contains the risk features and the claim number
while \code{freMTPL2sev} contains the claim amount and the
corresponding policy ID.
